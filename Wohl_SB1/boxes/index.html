<!-- Comments help you remember how and why any particular feature of your site has been constructed. Also, comments help other coders understand how you've done what you've done. And, comments are friendly. Use comments! That is, comment your code. 

The comment open and close tags are the top and bottom of these greyed out paragraphs.

Note: comments do not appear in the browser.

Divisions are made in the html structure with the <div> tag. This is how we manage complex html content so that various kinds of appearances and functionalities can be applied in the css.

The <div> tag shows you where the divisions begin and end. Note that each open <div> tag needs a corresponding close </div>.

The default positioning of an html page flows from top to bottom, with each new element appearing beneath the previous element. This rule applies to "block" elements, such as the p element and div elements.

There is another kind of element in html called "inline". These elements appear next to each other in a line. Pictures are examples of inline elements. To learn about positioning pictures, look at the style comments in the LinkDiv site.

<!-- p elements are block elements, so they are displayed by default as flowing from top to bottom, with an auto line-break inserted between them. Note in the browser that these two text elements are positioned on top of each other, but that there is no additional styling applied in the CSS.-->
